Assignment 2 for SWA
The GitHub project at https://github.com/olehougaard/weather_report is a web service that serves random weather data and predictions for Horsens, Aarhus and Copenhagen. You can download it from the site or clone it with git using
git clone https://github.com/olehougaard/weather_report.git
Create A non-interactive web page that shows weather data and predictions for each of the three cities. There are no requirements about styling or readability. The page should show
* All data for the latest measurement of each kind

* Minimum temperature for the last 5 days

* Maximum temperature for the last 5 days

* Total precipitation for the last 5 days

* Average wind speed for the last 5 days

* Dominant wind direction for the last 5 days

* Average cloud coverage for the last 5 days

* Hourly predictions for the next 24 hours.

Note: There is no requirement to use any of the previous models for this.

You must make two implementations of the web page:

a) Using XmlHttpRequest with callbacks

b) Using fetch with promises
